# Employee Directory Web Interface

This is a responsive, interactive Employee Directory web application built as per the AJACKUS frontend assignment specifications.  
It demonstrates clean UI/UX, modular code, client-side data management, and validations — using **HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript**, and a Freemarker-like templating simulation with local data.
